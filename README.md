# Odd Frontier Scorecard

A web-based utility to help track player scores, hit points (HP), and game turns for the "Odd Frontier" trading card game. This tool provides a clean interface for managing player stats and viewing game history.

I built this to run from my tablet at the table while playing the game.  

(*I did have some AI assistance in writing some of the code.*)

## Make Your Own or Run Locally
1. Download the script.js, style.css, and index.html in the same folder and run the index.html in your browser.
2. Load them on your website and have fun.
3. Duplicate it here on github and make a free gihub site with it.  (that's what I have done here)
